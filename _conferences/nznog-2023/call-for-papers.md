## Call For Papers
The NZNOG Trustees invite presentation proposals for the 20th (mostly) annual NZNOG conference, to be hosted at the Rydges Hotel in Rotorua  on March 23rd-24th, 2023. With the conference there will be a day of tutorials on the 22nd March.

## Conference objective
The NZNOG conference, workshops and tutorials are an opportunity for individuals and organisations involved in Internet operations to meet and share the latest in Internet operations, technologies, practices and receive high quality training.

The event is unique in New Zealand and attracts technical, skilled individuals with a genuine interest in Internet operations and Internetworking technologies.

Submissions on any aspect of networking are welcome however we are particularly interested in presentations that involve real world deployment experience, particularly in New Zealand.

We are intending that this conference is an in-person event. We would like to maintain the high level of NZ based presenters and content that we had in 2022.   We will also be accepting presentations from overseas speakers who can attend NZNOG in person. We do reserve the option of video presentation for highly valuable presentations but this is not our preference.  Conference registration for accepted presenters will be free.

## Submit a paper
Presenters are invited to submit presentation proposals for consideration by 30 January, 2023. Talks may be accepted earlier. Please provide your talk title, a short presenter bio and a description of the proposed presentation. Description should be no more than one page long and provide a summary of your networking related subject matter.

Normally presentations are 30 min long, are video streamed live and slide decks are posted to the NZNOG website.  If you want a different duration or other arrangements please let us know at submission time.

To submit your proposal please e-mail: [talks@nznog.org](mailto:talks@nznog.org)
