### Network Management and Monitoring
*APNIC*

**Date:** Wednesday 22 March 2023, 9am - 5pm

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce Network Management and Monitoring concepts by giving an overview of Network fundamentals, Linux fundamentals and exploring some of the Free Open Source Software (FOSS) tools that can be utilised for Network Management and Monitoring.

### RPKI
*APNIC*

**Date:** Wednesday 22 March 2023, 9am - 12.30pm

Why do we keep seeing news headlines about major networks not being reachable because traffic got rerouted to somewhere else? BGP mishaps are very common and frighteningly very easy. Examples are malicious route hijacking, mis-origination (fat fingers), and bad filters (route leaks). We need better mechanism(s) to ensure no one can inject false information into the global routing system that easily.

The RPKI part will look at current route filtering tools/techniques, how RPKI is just a piece in the puzzle, and what we should do to secure the internet routing.

### IPv6 Deployment
*APNIC*

**Date:** Wednesday 22 March 2023, 1.30pm - 5pm

This technical workshop teaches the concept of IPv6 protocol architecture, its addressing structure, design issues when planning for IPv6 deployment focusing on IP core network. It discusses network infrastructure design principles for dual stack deployment, OSPFv3, MP-BGP, transition technologies etc. Also presented for understanding and to encourage best practice knowledge.

Includes considerable practical work based on IPv6 and Cisco IOS router configuration commands.
