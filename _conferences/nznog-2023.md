NZNOG 2023 will be held in Rotorua, New Zealand, at the Rydges Hotel.

The conference proper will be on the 13th-14th April, 2023.

As usual, the conference will be on Thursday and Friday, with tutorials available on Wednesday 12th and a workshop from Monday to Wednesday. A dinner will be held on the Thursday night of the conference.

More details will be posted here when available. Expect a call for papers and an announcement when registrations open. A discount code will be available for the hotel. From our negotiations with hotels it has become clear that due to the return of tourism, accommodation could be in short supply so we recommend booking early.

We do have arrangements in place to allow postponement of the conference if the pandemic resurges but at this stage we do not anticipate that it will be necessary.

We are seeking sponsors and will shortly finalise our sponsorship document for NZNOG 2023. For details contact sponsorship@nznog.org.
