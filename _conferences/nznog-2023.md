Accommodation will be available from Rydges, and other nearby hotels. See the [Accommodation](nznog-2023/nznog-2023-accommodation.html) page for details when they become available.

More details will be posted here when available. Expect a call for papers and an announcement when registrations open. A discount code will be available for the hotel. From our negotiations with hotels it has become clear that due to the return of tourism, accommodation could be in short supply so we recommend booking early.

We do have arrangements in place to allow postponement of the conference if the pandemic resurges but at this stage we do not anticipate that it will be necessary.

We are seeking sponsors and will shortly finalise our sponsorship document for NZNOG 2023. For details contact sponsorship@nznog.org.
